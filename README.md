Tres (Spanish word for "three", pronounced `/tres/` ) is a way of creating ThreeJS scenes with Vue components in a declarative fashion. Think of it as a [React-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) or [Lunchbox](https://github.com/breakfast-studio/lunchboxjs) but without the need of a [custom Vue3 Renderer](https://vuejs.org/api/custom-renderer.html).
